In this project, I examined client churn within a banking institution, as well as the demographics that make up their client base. My analytical journey encompassed an array of tasks facilitated by SQL and Power BI, 
fostering a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Some of the key questions I tried answering while exploring this data set include:

Demographic Distribution: Looking at the geographic makeup, I meticulously gauged the client count across distinct countries, unraveling the spatial distribution of the bank's clientele.
Creditworthiness Insights: Computing the average credit scores per country â€” a vital metric of financial robustness.
Churn Dissection: An analysis unearthed the country exhibiting a pronounced churn rate, thus offering a granular understanding of regions where client attrition is more prevalent.
Product-Related Attrition: I explored the correlation between client attrition and product adoption, dissecting whether a correlation exists between the number of products and the likelihood of client drop-off.
Retained vs. Lost Customers: An important metric that provides a comprehensive overview of the customer base dynamics, shedding light on the intricate balance between customer retention and attrition.



In addition to these substantial insights, the project culminated in the creation of engaging visualizations that transcend mere numbers, providing stakeholders with a visual narrative of the analysis. 
These visualizations, in tandem with the code, embody the essence of the project, enabling stakeholders to intuitively absorb and appreciate the analytical prowess and consequential findings.

All code, questions, and images of the visualizations can be found in my GitHub repository for this project.
